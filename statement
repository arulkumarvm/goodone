Why you should never give up: 1. You haven’t tried everything yet. 2. You’re closer to success than you think. 3. If you don’t finish, someone else will. 4. Right before success there is a dark place. 5. If you give up - then what? 6. Past failure does not predict the future.

Before you speak THINK: T —is it true? H —is it helpful? I —is it inspiring? N —is it necessary? K —is it kind?

Don't value money more than time. That's a poor mindset. Time is finite. You can't produce time. Stop living like you're never going to die.

Goals should be: S - Specific. M - Measurable. A - Achievable. R - Realistic. T - Time-bound.
